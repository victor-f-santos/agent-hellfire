          Agent Hellfire is a thrash metal band formed in the spring of 2019.
          The band members originally from different parts of Brazil gathered in
          Berlin to make an old school metal, mixing it with modern elements,
          creating something heavy and authentic. Powerful voices, fast guitars,
          thoughtful lyrics and heavy drums turn the band into a new experience
          for headbangers everywhere. Bands like Testament, Exodus, Metallica
          are few of many influences to recreate that powerful sound that comes
          from the Bay Area. Its debut EP named "The Omen" is now available on
          your favorite streaming platform. Through pandemic times, the band
          managed to play a few concerts in Germany, the last one being at RUDE
          Festival in Saxony-Anhalt, sharing the stage with Brazil's greatest
          metal name: Sepultura. After the Guitar player parted ways with Agent
          Hellfire, the band started to look for a guitar player to join them
          and conquer the stages all over Europe. Check us out in your favorite
          audio platform, social media and sooner than you may expect, live!
