        <p class="band-bio">
          Agent Hellfire is a thrash metal band formed in the spring of 2019.
          The trio originally from Brazil gathered in Berlin to make an old
          school metal, mixing it with modern elements, creating something heavy
          and authentic. Powerful voices, fast guitars, thoughtful lyrics and
          heavy drums turn the band into a new experience for headbangers
          everywhere. Bands like Testament, Exodus, Metallica and even Sepultura
          are few of many influences to recreate that powerful sound that comes
          from the Bay Area. Its debut EP named "The Omen" is now available on
          your favorite streaming platform. Through pandemic times, the band
          managed to play a few concerts in Germany, the last one being at RUDE
          Festival in Saxony-Anhalt, sharing the stage with Brazilian metal’s
          greatest name: Sepultura. After the Guitar player parted ways with
          Agent Hellfire, the band started to look for a guitar player to join
          them and conquer the stages all over Europe.

          Born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, Victor started his journey on
          drums by the age of 14, taking classes at a local music school but his
          passion for making music started much earlier, when he had music
          classes in primary school. His first time on stage was three months
          after his first drum class, covering “when I come around” by Green
          Day, a few months later he was playing “I disappear” by Metallica.
          After being in a few college bands and hitting the stage a couple of
          times, he started the band Muqueta na Oreia, along with his high
          school friends, which turned out to be one of the biggest metal bands
          of Embu das Artes. The band is still active, releasing their 3rd album
          in 2022. Years after moving to Germany and playing in different bands,
          Munhoz, Mansur and Aldani gathered to form Agent Hellfire in 2019.
