        <p class="band-bio">
          Agent Hellfire is a thrash metal band formed in the spring of 2019.
          The trio originally from Brazil gathered in Berlin to make an old
          school metal, mixing it with modern elements, creating something heavy
          and authentic. Powerful voices, fast guitars, thoughtful lyrics and
          heavy drums turn the band into a new experience for headbangers
          everywhere. Bands like Testament, Exodus, Metallica and even Sepultura
          are few of many influences to recreate that powerful sound that comes
          from the Bay Area. Its debut EP named "The Omen" is now available on
          your favorite streaming platform. Through pandemic times, the band
          managed to play a few concerts in Germany, the last one being at RUDE
          Festival in Saxony-Anhalt, sharing the stage with Brazilian metalâ€™s
          greatest name: Sepultura. After the Guitar player parted ways with
          Agent Hellfire, the band started to look for a guitar player to join
          them and conquer the stages all over Europe.
